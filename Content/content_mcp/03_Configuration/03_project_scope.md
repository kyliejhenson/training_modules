## Content

Project-scoped servers enable team collaboration by storing configurations in a `.mcp.json` file at your project's root directory. This file is designed to be checked into version control, ensuring all team members have access to the same MCP tools and services.

### Example

```bash
# Add a project-scoped server
claude mcp add --transport http paypal --scope project https://mcp.paypal.com/mcp
```

The resulting `.mcp.json` file follows a standardized format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shared-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Security note

For security reasons, Claude Code prompts for approval before using project-scoped servers from `.mcp.json` files. If you need to reset these approval choices, use the `claude mcp reset-project-choices` command.
